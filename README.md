# Dot-Car
Made with JS and p5js. This was made as a personal project for me to learn the language more and to practice solving multiple issues that I 
ran into while making the game. I know it's not perfect and there are things I could make better, so I'd appreciate any input or fixes to make
the game run smoother!
